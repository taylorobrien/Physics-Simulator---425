Homework Assignment 6 - Physics

CS 425

	Code Choices/How to Play:
		-When the space bar is pressed, the fish will be launched in the direction of the barrel.
		-Each time the fish resets, the mass changes (and the size!), causing the user to have to change the 
		 velocity or direction to get the fish to go into the barrel. 
		-The score resets after 20 fish and the user gets the chance to play again.
		-Control:
			Z: Increases the velocity of the fish by 1.
			X: Decreases the velocity of the fish by 1.
			C: Decreases the angle of the fish by 10.
			V: Increases the angle of the fish by 10.


	Bugs in code:
		No bugs.
		
	Additional Comment: Since I am on a virtual machine, I am unable to get my cursor to click the button. There's
		a known issue with the mouse "jumping" locations - I am still looking into it, but for this assignment I never 
		was able to test the button. If the button doesn't work, I set up an alternative to press the Enter or Return button 
		to have the same functionality.
